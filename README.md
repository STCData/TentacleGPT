Welcome to TentacleGPT, a user-friendly UI editor and program for executing a network of GPT nodes!

TentacleGPT allows you to easily create and customize a network of GPT nodes, each with their own unique prompts and abilities. The program enables you to monitor the output of each node, regenerate it, freeze it, and view the history of generations.

With TentacleGPT, you can generate complex multimodal documents, such as comic books, presentations, screenplays, legal documents, websites, and software. The possibilities are endless!

To get started, simply create a new node and define its prompt and model. You can then connect this node to other nodes in the network, allowing for seamless communication and collaboration between models.

TentacleGPT also allows for the creation of subgraphs, enabling you to group together related nodes and streamline the generation process.

So what are you waiting for? Download TentacleGPT today and experience the power of GPT networks for yourself!
