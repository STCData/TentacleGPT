TentacleGPT is a UI editor and program that facilitates the execution of a network of GPT nodes to generate complex multimodal documents such as comic books, presentations, screenplays, legal documents, websites, and software. The nodes can consist of text to text generators like chatgpt, gpt4, llama, and other models, as well as text to image generators such as stable diffusion. TentacleGPT enables users to monitor the output of nodes, regenerate or freeze results, and view the history of each generation. The program also supports nodes that can generate the description of the network of nodes and subgraphs. The potential applications of TentacleGPT are vast, and it promises to redefine the landscape of content creation by leveraging the power of AI technology
 
Welcome to TentacleGPT, a user-friendly UI editor and program for executing a network of GPT nodes!

TentacleGPT allows you to easily create and customize a network of GPT nodes, each with their own unique prompts and abilities. The program enables you to monitor the output of each node, regenerate it, freeze it, and view the history of generations.

With TentacleGPT, you can generate complex multimodal documents, such as comic books, presentations, screenplays, legal documents, websites, and software. The possibilities are endless!

To get started, simply create a new node and define its prompt and model. You can then connect this node to other nodes in the network, allowing for seamless communication and collaboration between models.

TentacleGPT also allows for the creation of subgraphs, enabling you to group together related nodes and streamline the generation process.

So what are you waiting for? Download TentacleGPT today and experience the power of GPT networks for yourself!
